			My name is Yelena. I come from a journalist background, worked a lot in advertising and marketing.
			Started to do Barcamp conferences in Kazakhstan to promote and help internet development and startaps,
			and did it for 3 years. Basically most of the internet projects we have in the country now were born at
			barcamp. Moved to Russia and now work for Yandex. We did a lot with guys starting from doing conferences
			than turned all our behaviour upside down and what we have now and what we are going to share is basically it.

			Talking about Yandex, as a word it was born in 1993 and as a company in 2000. By now it's not only a
			search engine but also one of the biggest mail service, maps, marketplace, context advertisment system and so on.
			We are 50+ services and APIs with a daily audience of more then 50.5 million visitors.
			To develop these services we have 5,136 employees. And about 400 of them work in front-end.
			Yandex is a huge portal with consistent style guide and a lot of common interface pieces which we
			prefer to change rapidly and simultaneously. That's where BEM helped us a lot! But of course it works pretty
			good not just for big projects with large teams but for single freelancers, small teams or startups.

			At the same time we started to speed up in terms of number of similar interface, multipage services with user interactions. We grew in terms of people spread accross offices (we opened office in Saint Petersburg in 2006 and kept on opening, but now its 9 development offices). We talked with designers, backend developers, managers about same things but in different languages. It was a complete natural babeltower!

Vitaly, our boss, he leads the interface infrastructure development division at Yandex and he is the one who organized Yandex Development Office in Simferopol that now gave jobs to 200+ developers in Crimea). And invented Absolutely Independent Blocks concept that later on became BEM. What it was all about and what it helped us to solve back in 2006?

		<ul>
			<li>CSS classes forced us to reinvent names everyday...</li>
			<li class="next">... so, with BEM we get a naming convention!</li>
		</ul>
		<footer>
			It was a complete disaster. Imagine that you need to invent names for UI pieces everyday. And this pieces changes and names changes from service to service from team to team. And at the end they make no sense at all!
			So with BEM block__element__modifier simple rules we had at least understanding throughout of all Yandex services.
		</footer>

	<section class="slide"><div>
		<h2>Problems → Solution</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>0 incapsulation...</li>
			<li class="next">...so, BEM helped us incapsulate code on block level</li>
			<li class="next">and made possible to re-use</li>
		</ul>
		<footer>
			Not only from project to project, but between services profiting from the designer's idea of having common Yandex brand UI parts. Now we even have Yandex Lego Library that keeps these parts and a team that maintains it. With every new release services that are built on Yandex.Lego as a core library get pieces of common code tested and delivered and have time to concenrate on features.

	<section class="slide"><div>
		<h2>Problems → Solution</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Interactive interfaces...</li>
			<li class="next">...is no longer a threat with BEM plain file structure</li>
		</ul>
		<footer>
			Intecartive interfaces forced us to use more and more Javascript on the page that made maintainance harder and harder every day with high risks and no change to re-use it. Time of developement and maintainance grew up, developers went crazy trying to cope with it switching from project to project.
			So, guess how creating a plain file structure in BEM helped us live better life!
			Now you can simply find a block on the page, go into the BEM tree, find a block folder, find a technology file there (css, js, tests, docs, etc) and do whatever you need to do with it!

			Of course, there are side-effects as everywhere. One may say that now we get long css classes now one can write down. But we don't write them with our bare hands. We automated everything we can giving ourselves a chance to think of what we do and how we do that, and not to do something without thinking.

And we have the community now :) We volunteered long ago first with methodology & our experience sharing on conferences in CIS in Russian back in 2008-2009, that we open sourced code on github in 2010, than we started community management that basically means getting a site together, writing docs, arranging understandable and transparent workflow and release cycle, launching a forum to talk to developers, organizing practical webinars and BEMups. But thats all in Russian. What it gave us and who we are now?

			Most of the CIS based companies use not only a methodology but full stack of BEM.

			that means also you can relay on it more than a season long.
        	Unfortunately, this all great BEM party is only happening in Russian speaking countries. Where in English speaking countries thanks to Harry Roberts and some other great dudes BEM is known only as a methodoology for CSS. That's a pity for us, and we started to change the situation first from studing English hard ;))) Than writing docs. Than giving talks ourselves. Here I pass the word to my colleagues Vladimir, and he shall take you to BEM technically

			First of all let's define what are blocks, elements and modifiers.
			A block is an independent entity with its own meaning that represents a piece of interface on a page. It is a component in terms of web components specification.
			Blocks are intended to be reusable and easily extendable.

			Element is a part of block which has no meaning without it's parent block. Often elements are private part of API so you can think of them as of shadow DOM. But here you can see that we prefer convention over configuring: technically you can always interact with any element but because of our naming system one can't do it without [осознанного] intention.

			Modifiers represent differences between similar blocks and — which is more important — the state of a block or an element.

		<footer>
			And then CSS came.
CSS is so great because it’s declarative by design. You can declare rules for some selector and no matter how many nodes you need and how deep they are in DOM tree — when selector matches a node, it applies rules to it.

    background: <span class="param-val">red</span>;
<span class="blue">}</span></code></pre>

			They give us a way to develop components which intended to be easy to reuse.

			Encapsulate all techs inside in the same file actually which you are to link to your page.
			Hide elements which are useless without audio itself with SDOM.
			But browser support is still not so good.
			HTML imports which are similar to old school way of using tons of js libraries without building your project before deployment.

			There is no unified semantic model across different FE technologies

			Summary
BEM claims that simple semantic model (Blocks, Elements, and Modifiers) is enough to define the way you author HTML / CSS / JavaScript, structure code and components, set up interaction and scale your project to build an industry-leading service.
