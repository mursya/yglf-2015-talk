			My name is Yelena. I come from a journalist background, worked a lot in advertising and marketing.
			Started to do Barcamp conferences in Kazakhstan to promote and help internet development and startaps,
			and did it for 3 years. Basically most of the internet projects we have in the country now were born at
			barcamp. Moved to Russia and now work for Yandex. We did a lot with guys starting from doing conferences
			than turned all our behaviour upside down and what we have now and what we are going to share is basically it.

			Talking about Yandex, as a word it was born in 1993 and as a company in 2000. By now it's not only a
			search engine but also one of the biggest mail service, maps, marketplace, context advertisment system and so on.
			We are 50+ services and APIs with a daily audience of more then 50.5 million visitors.
			To develop these services we have 5,136 employees. And about 400 of them work in front-end.
			Yandex is a huge portal with consistent style guide and a lot of common interface pieces which we
			prefer to change rapidly and simultaneously. That's where BEM helped us a lot! But of course it works pretty
			good not just for big projects with large teams but for single freelancers, small teams or startups.

			Long sheets of static HTML, cascade, CSS with comments, than cut into XSL templates. Almost no Javascript. Early begining of making sites with multiple pages. Manual editing of everything with no garanty of mistakes that changes in one place can cause. Long boring monkey job.

			At the same time we started to speed up in terms of number of similar interface, multipage services with user interactions. We grew in terms of people spread accross offices (we opened office in Saint Petersburg in 2006 and kept on opening, but now its 9 development offices). We talked with designers, backend developers, managers about same things but in different languages. It was a complete natural babeltower!

			Than came these guys (by the way, one of them is here. Vitaly, our boss, he leads the interface infrastructure development division at Yandex and he is the one who organized Yandex Development Office in Simferopol that now gave jobs to 200+ developers in Crimea). And invented Absolutely Independent Blocks concept that later on became BEM. What it was all about and what it helped us to solve back in 2006?

		<h2>Problems we faced</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Low speed of rendering</li>
			<li>Naming that does not help</li>
			<li>Any interaction with code was dangerous because of 0 in capsulation</li>
			<li>and made it possible not only for maintainment but for re-use too</li>
		</ul>
		<footer>
			There are certain problems we faced. And not only we faced them. Most of them are still problems even when we have a lot of modern web development tools in our hands. So.

		<h2>Problems → Solution</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Long cascade affected speed of rendering...</li>
			<li class="next">... so, BEM helped us eliminate cascade</li>
			<li class="next">by using block__element_modifier naming system</li>
		</ul>
		<footer>
			With this plain structure CSS we get a profit in rendering
		</footer>
	</div></section>

		<section class="slide"><div>
		<h2>Problems → Solution</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>CSS classes forced us to reinvent names everyday...</li>
			<li class="next">... so, with BEM we get a naming convention!</li>
		</ul>
		<footer>
			It was a complete disaster. Imagine that you need to invent names for UI pieces everyday. And this pieces changes and names changes from service to service from team to team. And at the end they make no sense at all!
			So with BEM block__element_modifier simple rules we had at least understanding throughout of all Yandex services.
		</footer>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide"><div>
		<h2>Problems → Solution</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>0 incapsulation...</li>
			<li class="next">...so, BEM helped us incapsulate code on block level</li>
			<li class="next">and made possible to re-use</li>
		</ul>
		<footer>
			Not only from project to project, but between services profiting from the designer's idea of having common Yandex brand UI parts. Now we even have Yandex Lego Library that keeps these parts and a team that maintains it. With every new release services that are built on Yandex.Lego as a core library get pieces of common code tested and delivered and have time to concenrate on features.
		</footer>
	</div></section>

	<section class="slide"><div>
		<h2>Problems → Solution</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>More demand on interactive interfaces...</li>
			<li class="next">...was not longer a threat</li>
			<li class="next">BEM file structure gave an option to separate code according to technologies</li>
		</ul>
		<footer>
			Interactive interfaces forced us to use more and more Javascript on the page that made maintainance harder and harder every day with high risks and no change to re-use it. Time of developement and maintainance grew up, developers went crazy trying to cope with it switching from project to project.
			So, guess how creating a plain file structure in BEM helped us live better life!
			Now you can simply find a block on the page, go into the BEM tree, find a block folder, find a technology file there (css, js, tests, docs, etc) and do whatever you need to do with it!

			Of course, there are side-effects as everywhere. One may say that now we get long css classes now one can write down. But we don't write them with our bare hands. We automated everything we can giving ourselves a chance to think of what we do and how we do that, and not to do something without thinking.

			What does that mean? It means that we have a development team that develops it. We supports the product, bakes releases, writes docs, helps with difficulties, etc. We are small but we are brave! And we have the community now :) We volunteered long ago first with methodology & our experience sharing on conferences in CIS in Russian back in 2008-2009, that we open sourced code on github in 2010, than we started community management that basically means getting a site together, writing docs, arranging understandable and transparent workflow and release cycle, launching a forum to talk to developers, organizing practical webinars and BEMups. But thats all in Russian. What it gave us and who we are now?

			Most of the CIS based companies use not only a methodology but full stack of BEM.

			that means also you can relay on it more than a season long.
        	Unfortunately, this all great BEM party is only happening in Russian speaking countries. Where in English speaking countries thanks to Harry Roberts and some other great dudes BEM is known only as a methodoology for CSS. That's a pity for us, and we started to change the situation first from studing English hard ;))) Than writing docs. Than giving talks ourselves. Here I pass the word to my colleagues Vladimir, and he shall take you to BEM technically

			All these divs and spans gives developer no clue about what they really are.
Actualy we use just the same low level HTML invented for browsers in 1993.

But web applications nowadays are much closer to desktop applications then to static documents of Web 1.0. We need high level abstraction of assembler browsers suggest.

			First of all let's define what are blocks, elements and modifiers.
			A block is an independent entity with its own meaning that represents a piece of interface on a page. It is a component in terms of web components specification.
			Blocks are intended to be reusable and easily extendable.

			Element is a part of block which has no meaning without it's parent block. Often elements are private part of API so you can think of them as of shadow DOM. But here you can see that we prefer convention over configuring: technically you can always interact with any element but because of our naming system one can't do it without [осознанного] intention.

			Modifiers represent differences between similar blocks and — which is more important — the state of a block or an element.
